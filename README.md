# g8keep

g8keep is a web- and/or mobile-based app (OR potential text and/or email-based subscription service) that generates a list of things to do -- scraping forums, blogs, event apps (e.g. Airbnb experiences, ra.co), op-eds, local event calendars, local social media (e.g. Facebook events) metadata and/or geoactivity, etc.

The program uses machine learning to fine-tune its profile of YOU -- your interests, your hobbies, your budget, your schedule, etc. 
The more information provided, the better g8keep will be able to service you and recommend the best things to do. 

In considering how to plan your perfect day, g8keep keeps into account the amount of time until the event begins, location (or distance from user's current location) and commuting costs/time, money value (as defined as a % for cost of attendance / budget) [i.e. max limit price].
